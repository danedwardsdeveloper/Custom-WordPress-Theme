**A personal blog inspired by [TikTok Creator Academy](https://www.tiktok.com/creator-academy), which has a modern and fun style with big flashes of colour. Weirdly, the original site is not responsive - if you view on a mobile, it has a massive horizontal scroll bar because the header stays exactly the same.**
